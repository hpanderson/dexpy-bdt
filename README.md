# Design of Experiments in Python

This is a [slide deck](https://hpanderson.github.io/dexpy-bdt) for a
presentation on using [dexpy](https://statease.github.io/dexpy/) for doing
Design of Experiments in Python.

You can view the
[slide deck here](https://hpanderson.github.io/dexpy-bdt/#/),
and also see the
[notebook it's based on](https://github.com/hpanderson/dexpy-bdt/blob/master/dexpy-demo.ipynb)
directly in github.

Thanks to Amit Saha for the idea of using gh-pages for hosting the presentation,
in [this blog post](http://echorand.me/presentation-slides-with-jupyter-notebook.html).
